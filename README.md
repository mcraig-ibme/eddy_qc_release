SQUAT is a tool for generating individual subject and group QC reports from JSON data written
out by a processing pipeline.

SQUAT is heavily based on QUAD/SQUAD from EDDY_QC - tools based on FSL's eddy (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/eddy) 
to perform quality assessment on diffusion mri (dMRI) datasets. For more information on EDDY_QC see:
